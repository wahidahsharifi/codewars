You are a sheep farmer, and are now plagued by wolves which pretend to be sheep. Fortunately, you are good at spotting them. </p><p>Warn the sheep in front of the wolf that it is about to be eaten. Remember that you are standing <strong>at the front of the queue</strong> which is at the end of the array:</p><pre><code>[sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, sheep, sheep]      (YOU ARE HERE AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE)   7      6      5      4      3            2      1</code></pre><p>If the wolf is the closest animal to you, return <code>"Pls go away and stop eating my sheep"</code>. Otherwise, return <code>"Oi! Sheep number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!"</code> where <code>N</code> is the sheep's position in the queue.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> there will always be exactly one wolf in the array.</p><h3 id="examples">Examples</h3><p>Input: <code>["sheep", "sheep", "sheep", "wolf", "sheep"]</code><br>Output: <code>"Oi!
