For one kind of boxesthe printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity,are named with letters from <code>a to m</code>. </p><p>The colors used by the printer arerecorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be<code>aaabbbbhaijjjm</code> meaning that the printer used three times color a, four timescolor b, one time color h then one time color a...</p><p>Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. <code>aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm</code> with letters not from <code>a to m</code>.</p><p>You have to write a function <code>printer_error</code> which given a string will returnthe error rate of the printer as a <strong>string</strong> representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string.Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.</p><p>The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from <code>a</code>to <code>z</code>.</p><h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4><pre><code>s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"printer_error(s) =&gt; "0/14"s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"printer_error(s) =&gt; "8/22"</code></pre>
